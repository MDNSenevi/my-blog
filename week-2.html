               <h4>What did I do yesterday?</h3>
               <ul>
                    <li>Conducted majority of the user interviews for the primary research.</li>
                    <ul>
                         <li>Based on what we covered, I don't think I can pursue the 'food security' as all respondents yesterday didn't face that hardship.</li>
                         <li>Emerging pain point seems to be around planning and decision makeing around meal planning.</li>
                         <li>Interesting to note that based on secondary research food waste is generated because of ill planning - so there might be a problem in that.</li>
                    </ul>
               </ul>
               <h4>What will I do today?</h3>
               <ul>
                    <li>Complete the remainder of the interviews.</li>
                    <li>Start detailed analysis for the interviews.</li>

               <ul>
                    <li>Not for today - but I can see I won't have as much time as I would like this week due to attending the symposium and workshops related to it.</li>

               <h3>Week 2 Retrospective</h3>
               <h4>What went well?</h4>
               <ul>
                    <li>I managed to narrow my problem statement based on the emerging themes from the interviews.</li>
                    <li>I also managed to complete my interviews in two days - which is great!</li>
                    <li>Planning out the second week went better than first week.</li>
                    <li>Learned so much during the 'Designing Futures' symposium and workshop &mdash; so inspiring! :D</li>
               </ul>
               <h4>What didn't go well?</h4>
               <ul>
                    <li>I didn't realise how much time will be taken by the symposium and attending the workshop beforehand.</li>
                    <li>My planning needs to be a bit more detailed and look ahead.</li>
                    <li>I still need to work on the weekend and play catch up &mdash; on the analysis and problem statement refinment.</li>
               </ul>
               <h4>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</h4>
               <ul>
                    <li>Have a more detailed plan for the next few week by end of Sunday.</li>
                    <ul>
                         <li>There are lots of personal events and assignments coming up in the next two weeks.</li>
